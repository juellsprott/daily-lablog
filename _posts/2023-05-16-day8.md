After recently gaining access to the Snellius systems through my supervisors, I have spent some time configuring the connection in order to leverage the system's A100 GPU and large memory in order to perform inference on my laptop through Visual Studio Code, rather than just my home PC and LAB42 Robolab workstations. The steps are as follows:

    ```
    ssh name@snellius.surf.nl
