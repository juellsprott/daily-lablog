Started working with BLIP-2 model for the first time. First attempted some examples with an [online demo API](https://replicate.com/andreasjansson/blip-2) using nucleus sampling and a temperature of 1. 
- Model tends to generate relatively vague/ambitious descriptions, ignoring some of the smaller details that define the novelty of the object
- Occasionally makes assumptions about what the object could possibly be
- 2005 predicted as "a colorful headband with a rainbow design"
