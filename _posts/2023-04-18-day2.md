Attempted to run the BLIP-2 model locally using link provided at the [BLIP-2 Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/BLIP2) page. Running the following cell:

which results in a memory error as both models are too large for the memory allowed in a free Google Colab environment. 

Instead, I found the following page on [Lavis repository](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip2) which provides documentation on the Hugging Face implementation that allows for int8 quantization using bitsandbytes and accelerate modules, allowing for far lower memory usage.

First attempt at running this on a workstation in the LAB42 Robolab results in various CUDA-related errors, likely indicating incorrect libraries or modules installed.
