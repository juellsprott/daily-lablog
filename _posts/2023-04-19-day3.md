Used earliero[online demo API](https://replicate.com/andreasjansson/blip-2) for BLIP-2 from replicate in order to caption a large amount of the NOUN dataset during second supervisor meeting for first impressions. These results were shown during a live demo, and thus have not been documented yet. Once the model is running on either a local machine or a remote system, I will attempt to caption the entire dataset and provide a table with results here. 

Furthermore, after inspecting the supplied NOUN dataset [here](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=noun-database-2nded-usletter.pdf&site=390) and [here](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=what-are-the-noun-objects-really.pdf&site=390), it has come to my attnetion that most of the data is provided in a PDF file written as a book section, rather than a structure that can be used to easily obtain data and figures, thus, I have decided to manually obtain data from the pdf and create my own .csv file. The code for this can be found in my repository within the create_dataset.py script:

```
with open('dataset.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['image_path', 'number label', 'actual name', 'familiarity score', 'nameability score', 'color saliency', 'texture saliency'])
    for filename, label, true, fam, name, color in zip(os.listdir(folder_path), label, true_name, fam_scores, name_scores, color_scores):
        if filename.endswith('.jpg'):
            image_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
            writer.writerow([image_path, label, true, fam, name, color])
```

This code does work however will require some cleaning and optimization and a check for correctness.
